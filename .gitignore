## CocoaPods GitIgnore Template

# CocoaPods - Only use to conserve bandwidth / Save time on Pushing
#           - Also handy if you have a large number of dependant pods
#           - AS PER https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html NEVER IGNORE THE LOCK FILE

# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:

## Documentation cache and generated files:
/.yardoc/
/_yardoc/

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle/
/vendor/bundle
/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc
